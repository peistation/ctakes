Introduction
############

The CdaCasInitializer annotator transforms a Common Data Architecture (CDA) document into plain text,
provided the CDA document conforms to the DTD resources.

As part of the conversion to plaintext, section (segment) markers are inserted into the text, 
hyphens are inserted into words that should be hyphenated.
The resulting text in stored in a new View, which has its own Sofa. 

Sections are detected and Segment (aka section) annotations are added to the CAS. 
Document level data is extracted and stored in the CAS as Property annotations.

This does not handle all CDA documents -- the CDA document must conform to the DTD.

AggregateAE.xml

The file desc/AggregateAE.xml defines a "pipeline" for preprocessing documents.
The "pipeline" is a simple pipeline with only one delegate analysis engine (one 
annotator), the CdaCasInitializer, and is included for testing.  Typically the 
CdaCasInitializer.xml descriptor is included in a more complete pipeline rather
than using the AggregateAE.xml descriptor that is in this project.

CdaCasInitializer.xml

The CdaCasInitializer descriptor defines the analysis engine (annotator) for 
preprocessing documents. 

It takes no parameters.

It creates a plaintext view from a CDA view. 
The plaintext view can then annotated for tokens, parts of speech, chunks, etc.
