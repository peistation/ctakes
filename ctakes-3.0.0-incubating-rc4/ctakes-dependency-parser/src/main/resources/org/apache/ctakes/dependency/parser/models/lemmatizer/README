The file wordnet-3.0-lemma-data.jar is a data file that can be used by LemmaAnnotator.  
It was built using WordNet version 3.0 data and is therefore subject to any 
restrictions imposed by the WordNet license which appears to be very similar
to the BSD license (both WordNet software and database.)
