LVG
~~~
This annotator wraps the National Library of Medicine (NLM)
link:{lvg-home}[SPECIALIST lexical tools]. It generates a canonical
form for words and also generates a list of lemma entries with Penn
Treebank tags. These tags could be useful for a part of speech (POS)
tagger. However, for the OpenNLP POS tagger, we use a tag dictionary
rather than lemma information.

See the <<cd_pos_tagger,documentation>> for the POS tagger annotator.

Analysis engines (annotator)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- *LvgAnnotator.xml*
+
*Parameters*::
  UseSegments;; controls whether only certain sections will be annotated by this annotator
  SegmentsToSkip;; list of sections not to be processed by this annotator
  UseCmdCache;; controls whether to look up information in a cache before using norm
  CmdCacheFileLocation;; location of norm cache file
  CmdCacheFrequencyCutoff;; (cutoff value)
  ExclusionSet;; words for which canonicalForm is never set and Lemma entries are never posted
  XeroxTreebankMap;; mapping of part of speech tags used by LVG to POS tags from lexical tools to Penn Treebank tags
  PostLemmas;; controls whether any lemma entries are posted to the CAS
  UseLemmaCache;; controls whether to look up lemma information in a cache before using lvg
  LemmaCacheFileLocation;; the location of the cache file
  LemmaCacheFileFrequencyCutoff;; (cutoff value)

////////////////////////
NOTE: As distributed, PostLemmas is set to false. This is done to reduce the size of the CAS.
Set PostLemmas to true to have edu.mayo.bmi.uima.core.type.Lemma annotations added to the CAS.

Resources
^^^^^^^^^
- *lvg.properties*
+
The LVG config file +resources/lvg/data/config/lvg.properties+ defines the location
and attributes of the LVG database and the jdbc driver used.
+
- *LVG database*
+
The database engine used is hsqldb. The database file included is a
sample. See <<boost_performance>> for details on how to replace the sample.
