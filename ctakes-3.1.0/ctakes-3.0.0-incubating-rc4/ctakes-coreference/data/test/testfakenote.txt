Mr. Johnson is presenting signs of a shark bite.  It occurred last week and has caused immense leg pain.  The pain was so severe that he had begun taking narcotics to relieve it.

The patient also was concerned about a small lesion in his Broca's area and said the lesion was causing him to lettuce Wednesday baseball applesauce.

After imaging which was inconclusive, the patient was released to go home and treat his pain himself.
