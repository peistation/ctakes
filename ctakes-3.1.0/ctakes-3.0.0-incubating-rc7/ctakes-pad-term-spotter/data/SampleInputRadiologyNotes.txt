Comparison with prior MR angiography dated 4-2-04. Again seen is a large ventral hernia containing multiple nonobstructed loops of small bowel and ascending colon. No evidence of vascular compromise within this hernial sac. PO changes of aortobifemoral graft with occluded right limb of the graft just below the bifurcation. Patent femoral crossover graft. Possible diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Severe atrophy of the left kidney. The left renal artery is not well delineated and may be occluded. Small scarring in the lower right kidney. Low-lying urinary bladder with a possible small cystocele. Sigmoid diverticulosis. Vascular calcifications. Degenerative changes of the spine, symphysis pubis, and both SI and hip joints. Minimal atelectasis or fibrosis in the lung bases. Remainder of the study is unremarkable.. W. R. Davis MD 5-4321

Patent left femoral-popliteal  bypass. Diffuse tibial artery disease with posterior tibial occlusion. The anterior tibial is patent into the dorsalis pedis and the peroneal artery contributes to the plantar arch via a patent calcaneal branch. Right hypogastric artery stenosis. W. R. Davis MD 5-4321

No comparison exam. Along the mid left femoral diaphysis there is an aggressive, malignant appearing process involving the lateral cortex. Adjacent cortical scalloping is present. Codman's triangle's are seen at either end of the lesion consistent with aggressive periosteal reaction. The area of cortical scalloping measures 4.5 cm in length. There is some probable hazy mineral content within the peripheral lucent area suggesting that this is a malignant surface Osteogenic sarcoma. The other consideration is a periosteal Ewing's sarcoma. No associated soft tissue mass or fluid collections. Recommend further evaluation with MRI to evaluate for left femoral bone marrow involvement. Exam was discussed with Dr .W. R. Davis MD 5-4321

Ulceration of soft tissues distally. No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis. The right popliteal artery is largely obscured by metallic artifact from a right TKA. No radiographic evidence of loosening. Extensive arterial calcification. Cast obscures detail. W. R. Davis MD 5-4321

The fracture extends proximally into the greater humeral tuberosity and, to a lesser degree, the inferior aspect of the lesser tuberosity. The articular surface of the humeral head is intact and glenohumeral alignment maintained. W. R. Davis MD 5-4321
