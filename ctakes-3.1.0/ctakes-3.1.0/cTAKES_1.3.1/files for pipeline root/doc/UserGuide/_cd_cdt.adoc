Context dependent tokenizer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This annotator creates annotations from one or more tokens, using
surrounding tokens as clues. An example of an annotation created from
multiple tokens is a range that includes 2 numbers and a dash
(e.g. 2-3).

// This annotator depends on finite state machine (FSM) code in the project named core.


Analysis engines (annotators)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- *ContextDependentTokenizerAnnotator.xml*

--
Include this analysis engine in your pipeline if you wish to have the
following annotations created:

anchor:cdt_annot[]

  * DateAnnotation
  * FractionAnnotation
  * MeasurementAnnotation
  * PersonTitleAnnotation
  * RangeAnnotation
  * RomanNumeralAnnotation
  * TimeAnnotation

*Parameters*::
    (none)

- *TestTAE.xml*

This is an aggregate analysis engine that can be used to run a short
pipeline that takes plain text as input and annotates for tokens,
sentences, and for the <<cdt_annot,annotations>> created by the
context dependent tokenizer annotator.

NOTE: This aggregate does not override any parameters or resource
bindings.
