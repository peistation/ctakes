This directory contains the resources needed to create the lucene index for assertion cue phrae lookup.

To build the index, run the class (in src/main/java):
  org.apache.ctakes.dictionary.assertion.CreateAssertionLuceneIndexFromDelimitedFile

The files in this directory are pipe delimited files with the following format:

  cue_phrase:cue_phrase_category:cue_phrase_family

The "cue phrase" is the string itself.  For example, "no evidence of".

The "cue phrase category" is something like -- no, not, speculation_low, speculation_high, etc.

The "cue_phrase_family" is the general category of cue phrase.  Generally this aligns with the assertion attribute being set:
  * negation (for the polarity attribute)
  * uncertainty
  * subject
  * generic
