
This information relates to building ctakes-2.6-incubating

First, check out all projects from SVN.
For example, assertion and chunker are separate projects.

There are three ant scripts used to build cTAKES. The ant scripts
can be found in project 'files for pipeline root'.

The ant scripts rely on ant-contrib.jar and on xmltask.jar,
which are separate downloads. 
They also depend on UIMA, which is a separate download available 
from http://uima.apache.org/

The three ant scripts are:

 build_step1.xml: Generate type system (jcasgen) and compile code.
 
 build_step2.xml: Reorganize directories so there is a single bin
                  directory, so all descriptors are within a single
                  subtree (under cTAKESdesc), and so all resources 
                  are within a single subtree (under resources).
              
 build_step3.xml: Create a single jar file with all .class files
                  from bin and from all dependent jars.

Script build_step1 relies on values within build_step1.properties
Script build_step2 relies on values within build_step2.properties

Update those properties files for your environment.

Script build_step3 relies on the basedir value within build_script3.xml

Update the basedir value for your environment
