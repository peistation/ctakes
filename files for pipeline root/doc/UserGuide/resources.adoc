Boosting Performance
--------------------
Due to the size of the LVG dictionary, we do not redistribute it in
{osp-short}. You can download it from link:{lvg-home}[] and
swap out the sample dictionary. We have successfully tested the 2008
release in our organization, but NLM may have a newer release when you
read this. To use the 2008 release:

. Download either the full version or the lite version from
  http://lexsrv2.nlm.nih.gov/LexSysGroup/Projects/lvg/2008/
. Replace the directory
  +{inst-root-dir}/LVG/resources/lvg/data/HSqlDb+ with +data/HSqlDb+
  from your extracted download.

Models included in {osp-short} may not represent your data
distribution well, if you want to build your own models, please read
<<component_description>>, particularly on:

- <<train_sentdetect_model, training a sentence detector model>>
- <<build_postag_model, building a POS tagger model>>
- <<build_postag_dict, building a POS tag dictionary>>
- <<build_chunker_model, building a chunker model>>
